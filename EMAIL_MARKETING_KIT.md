## 📨 Cold Email Templates (The First Contact)

### Template 1: The "Safety & Savings" Angle (Best for Safety Directors)
**Subject:** Reducing bridge strikes for [Company Name] fleet?
**Subject:** Question about [Company Name]'s navigation safety

Hi [Name],

I'm writing because bridge strikes cost the trucking industry over $100M annually, and I wanted to see how [Company Name] is currently protecting your drivers from low clearance routes.

I represent **TruckNavPro**, a professional navigation app designed specifically to prevent these costly accidents. Unlike standard GPS, we route strictly based on:
*   ✅ Vehicle Height & Weight
*   ✅ Bridge Clearances
*   ✅ Hazmat Restrictions

We're currently helping fleets reduce navigation-related incidents by up to 40%.

Would you be open to a 3-day free trial for a few of your drivers to see if it improves their routes?

Best,

### Template 2: The "Cost Saving" Angle (Best for Owners/CFOs)
**Subject:** Cutting navigation costs for [Company Name]
**Subject:** 15k saved per avoided incident

Hi [Name],

Quick question: what are you currently paying for your fleet's GPS hardware or subscriptions?

Most fleets overpay for dedicated hardware that requires updates and maintenance. **TruckNavPro** turns every driver's smartphone into a professional-grade trucking GPS for just **$9.99/month** – fully tax-deductible.

*   No hardware to install
*   Always up-to-date maps
*   Real-time traffic & hazard alerts
*   Routing for specific truck dimensions

We offer bulk pricing for fleets of 10+ trucks.

Are you available for a 5-minute chat next Tuesday morning to discuss a pilot program?

Regards,

[Your Name]

## 🔄 Follow-Up Emails (Send 3-5 days later)

### Follow-Up 1: The "Did you see this?"
**Subject:** Re: Reducing bridge strikes for [Company Name] fleet?

Hi [Name],

I wanted to quickly bump this up in your inbox.

Ensuring your drivers have the best tools to avoid low bridges and restricted routes is critical for safety and insurance premiums.

Did you have a chance to look at TruckNavPro? I'd be happy to set up a free Extended Trial for your fleet to test out.

Best,

[Your Name]

### Follow-Up 2: The "Case Study" (Social Proof)
**Subject:** What other fleets are saying about TruckNavPro

Hi [Name],

One of our recent users mentioned: *"Saved me from a 12'6" bridge that my old GPS tried to send me under. Worth every penny."*

We want to bring this same peace of mind to [Company Name]'s drivers.

Is navigating restricted routes a current challenge for your team, or are you happy with your current solution?

Thanks,

[Your Name]

## 👋 The "Break-Up" Email (Send 7-10 days after last follow-up)

### Template: Permission to close file
**Subject:** Permission to close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I assume improving your fleet's navigation safety isn't a priority right now, or you're all set with your current system.

I'll go ahead and close my file for now so I don't bother you again.

If you ever need a reliable truck GPS solution in the future, you know where to find us.

Best of luck,

[Your Name]
TruckNavPro

*(Note: This email often gets a response because people hate "closing files" or missing out!)*

## 💡 Best Practices for Cold Emailing

*   **Personalize:** Mention their company name or local area. Don't sound like a robot.
*   **Keep it Short:** Fleet managers are busy. Get to the point in 2-3 sentences.
*   **One Call to Action (CTA):** Ask for ONE thing (a reply, a trial download, or a 5-min call). Not all three.
*   **Follow Up:** 80% of sales happen after the 5th contact. Don't give up after one email!
*   **Track Opens:** Use a free tool like HubSpot or Mailtrack to see if they open your emails.
