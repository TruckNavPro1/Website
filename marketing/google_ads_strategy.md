## 2. Campaign Strategy

### Option A: App Campaigns (Recommended)
Google's **Universal App Campaigns (UAC)** are the most effective for mobile apps.
*   **How it works:** You provide text, images, and videos. Google automatically shows ads across Search, Play Store, YouTube, and Display Network to find users likely to install.
*   **Bid Strategy:** Target CPA (Cost Per Action) - set to **$2.50 per install** initially.
*   **Assets Needed:**
    *   Your App Store Link.
    *   Headlines: "Avoid Low Bridges", "Truck Specific Routing", "Pro GPS for Truckers".
    *   Descriptions: "Navigate confidently with custom truck routes. Download TruckNavPro today."
    *   Images/Videos: Use your existing demo video and screenshots.

### Option B: Search Network (Text Ads)
Target users actively searching for solutions.
*   **Keywords:**
    *   "truck gps app"
    *   "commercial truck navigation"
    *   "low bridge avoidance app"
    *   "gps for semi trucks"
    *   "truck route planner"
*   **Negative Keywords:** "free", "garmin", "rand mcnally" (unless targeting competitors), "car gps".
