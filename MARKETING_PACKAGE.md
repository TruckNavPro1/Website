Title: Just found an app that's already saved me from 2 low bridges this week

Hey fellow drivers,

Wanted to share this because I almost made a $15k mistake last Monday. Was heading under a bridge that my regular GPS said was fine, but TruckNavPro screamed at me just in time.

It's called TruckNavPro and it's specifically for truck drivers. Does all the stuff your regular GPS doesn't:
- Warns about low bridges
- Shows weight restrictions  
- Knows about truck bans
- Routes you around hazmat restricted areas

I'm on the free trial right now (3 days) and honestly it's already worth the $9.99/mo they charge after.

Not affiliated with them or anything, just a driver who's tired of playing bridge roulette.

App Store link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trucknavpro1/id6755080720

Stay safe out there!
